#Rap Name Generator

__Skill Level:__ Intermediate  
__Time Limit:__ 30 minutes  

This is a fun challenge intended to help you develop your skills in Object Oriented Javascript. Here you'll be working to finish an incomplete name generator that with some given input from the user should randomly output a hilarious rap name reminiscent of 90's supergroup, the Wu-Tang Clan.

##Instructions
The expected randomized output should follow these patterns given a user submits the name `Ellen`:

- Inspectah Ellen
- E.L.L.E.N. the Chef
- Ellen the Chef
- Inspectah E
- Inspectah Ellen the Chef

__NOTE:__ Your final product should behave somewhat like [this](https://jaybobo.github.io/projects/rap-name-gen/). Feel free to make it your own.

##Things To Think About
- How will you structure your code?  
- Did you remember to validate user input?  
- What are the differences between class and prototype-based inheritance?
